          Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a
          single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the
          directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is
          center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men
          make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory. Science cuts two ways,
          of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back
          from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science. What
          was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that
          they set eye on the earth. A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who,
          upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt
          seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.
